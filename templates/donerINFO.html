        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;" >  Even though you may be enthusiastic about donating blood, you may not be eligible. 
          This is determined through an initial screening process. The donor must be 18 to 65 years of age with a minimum weight of 45 kg. 
          The blood collected needs to be clean and disease-free. Post-screening, all donated blood samples are tested to ensure that no
           diseases are transmitted.

        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;" >Associating with a trusted blood bank or hospital is extremely 
            essential where all necessary procedures to collect blood in a safe manner are followed. Donation is done in a 
            seated or lying position and is performed by a trained healthcare professional. A sterile needle is inserted in the elbow
             for 8-10 minutes for 350-450 ml of blood. Post this, the blood is collected in sample tubes.

        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:40px; " >Be well-hydrated and do not miss meals</p>
        <p style="text-align:center; font-size:20px;" >
                One should have a proper meal and be adequately hydrated before donating blood to prevent weakness. 
                Avoid fatty foods before donating as the fat can affect the blood processing tests. Eating iron-rich foods can help as it
                 increases the haemoglobin.

                    Take note of prescribed medications, if any, and inform the staff during registration about the same.
                     One may not realise but a simple medication taken for influenza can defer the blood donation process for two weeks.

                    Post blood donation, a small bandage is put on the area from where blood has been extracted. Keep this on for at least two-four hours. 
                    If you start to bleed, raise the arm above the head and apply pressure until it stops. If hurting persists, apply ice. If you’re not
